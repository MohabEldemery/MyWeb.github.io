			<h1 id="about">About me</h1>
			<p>
				

				First of all, let me introduce myself,<br>
				I am Mohab Eldemery. I have attending my B.Sc degree in Computer Science Engineering from University of Debrecen class of 2024.

				The undergraduate curriculum in Computer Science Engineering at institute of technology, Debrecen University, introduces me to a wide variety of engineering subjects.Various courses like [Artificial Intelligence, Programming Languages, Electronics, Software Engineering, System Programming, Interfacing & Assembly language, Algorithm Analysis and Design, Digital Desgin , Signal and Systems, Network, Computer graphics, Computer Modelling]<br>which provided me with a strong footing in the theoretical concept of Computer Science and Engineering.

				While offering both depth and breadth across this field, these courses put into perspective the importance and relevance of Computer Science Engineering and the application of its fundamentals to the problems faced by the real world.<br>
				
				</p>
				<p>
				By learning and developing my knowledge of Computer Engineering, I can make a significant contribution to society, 
				especially as our country is transitioning from manual systems to computerized ones.
				<br>I am enthusiastic about acquiring and understanding new technologies and engineering concepts because the demand for computer engineering in various industries is increasing. I believe that it is my responsibility to make significant contributions to this field, which can lead to a better future for everyone. As a highly sought-after field, Computer Science Engineering offers a range of career opportunities and high salaries, and it is constantly evolving, providing continuous learning and new challenges.

			<h4>Hobbies</h4>
			<p>
			I like learning new skills and recently I have been interested in exploring different languages as they help me explore new cultures around the world.
			I started learning Italian online and I have already cleared the beginner level. 
			I generally spend my weekends focusing on exploring new Italian words and watching Italian movies to strengthen my grasp over the language.
			<br>
			I like participating in volunteer activities especially teaching kids.
 			I have been associated with a few non-profit organisations since my high school days and 
			I like spending my weekends helping these NGOs for different activities from teaching to organising interesting games and activities to make learning fun for everyone especially kids.
						
			</p>

			<br>

			<p>
			My favourite hobby is travelling because I love discovering new cities and places around the world.
			I often save up for months to plan a trip every year. 
			I love friend's trips and family outings but solo travelling brings me the real adventure and thrill to venture into new places all by myself.
			<br>
			I admire water sports as swimming,it is a great and relaxing way to spend time.
			Also dancing is a great exercise and a fun way to spend time.
